#FoldersTranspiler

Just a simple program to transpile c# to the Folders programming language.

The original Folders Compiler is at https://github.com/rottytooth/Folders

My fork currently (as of 12/11) has a few bug fixes https://github.com/DatBear/Folders

Everything at https://esolangs.org/wiki/Folders as of 12/11 is implemented, except float types.

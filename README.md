# FoldersTranspiler

Just a simple program to transpile c# to the Folders programming language.

The original Folders Compiler is at https://github.com/rottytooth/Folders

My fork (https://github.com/DatBear/Folders) currently (as of 12/11) has a few bug fixes. Everything at https://esolangs.org/wiki/Folders as of 12/11 is implemented in this transpiler, except float types. Error handling is minimal.
